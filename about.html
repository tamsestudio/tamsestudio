    	<p>Photographer from California üå¥, currently based in London üêÄ. Looking for work opportunities as a freelance or full-time photographer, lighting and set design assistant, print coordinator, or project manager. </p><p>

From 2014 ‚Äî 2016 I worked on my Masters degree in Photography at the Royal College of Art, which had a fine art focus. After graduating I worked for a year as a student union president, helping shape student life for graduate and research students, and bridge the gap between students and the college.</p><p>

My work centres on masculinity and unique printing techniques, and i‚Äôm looking to take this approach into editorial and commercial application.

Francesca Tamse (b. SF Bay Area, California) works and lives in London. She graduated with a BA in Photography from the School of Visual Arts, New York in 2013. As a fond NY experience, she had focused on producing zines and photobooks, organising zine fairs, and everything in between working with 8-Ball Zines (now, 8-Ball community). Upon graduation, she received the RCA residency award and has left the US ever since. Her collaged images and playful modes of display can be found in self-published books and special one-offs that are printed on various surfaces. She graduated in MA Photography at the Royal College of Art in 2016.</p><p>
Francesca was shortlisted for Unseen Book Dummy Award and has been featured in Vogue Italia, 1Granary, and Dear Dave. Her work has also appeared in exhibitions including Scratch the Surface, curated by Trine Stephensen at Aldama Fabre Gallery, ES and On Landscape, Mat√®ria Gallery, IT. She is represented by MARYMARY projects in NYC.
